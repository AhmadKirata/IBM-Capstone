# IBM-Capstone

Description: This repository contains my final project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera. The project involved analyzing data related to SpaceX launches and building predictive models to help optimize future launches.

Project Overview:

The primary goal of the project was to analyze data from past SpaceX launches and identify factors that could impact the success of future launches. The project involved the following steps:

- Data acquisition: The data was obtained from various sources, including SpaceX's official website, NASA's open data portal, and other publicly available sources.

- Data exploration and cleaning: The data was explored and cleaned to remove missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies that could affect the accuracy of the models.

- Data analysis and visualization: The data was analyzed and visualized to identify patterns and trends that could help in building the predictive models.

- Feature selection and engineering: The most relevant features were selected and engineered to create a set of predictors that could be used in the machine learning models.

- Model development and evaluation: Several machine learning models were developed and evaluated using various metrics to determine their accuracy and effectiveness in predicting the success of SpaceX launches.

Skills and Tools:

- Data acquisition and cleaning using Python and Pandas.
- Data analysis and visualization using Python and Matplotlib.
- Machine learning using Python and scikit-learn.

Results:

The final machine learning models achieved high accuracy in predicting the success of SpaceX launches. The models can be useful for SpaceX engineers and officials in identifying potential issues and taking proactive measures to ensure the success of future launches.

Conclusion:

This project showcases my skills in data science, including data acquisition, data cleaning, data analysis, and machine learning. I am excited to continue learning and applying these skills in real-world scenarios to solve complex problems using data-driven approaches.

Feel free to explore the project and provide feedback.
